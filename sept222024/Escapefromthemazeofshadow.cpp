/*cape from the Maze of Shadows
In the heart of the ancient city of Labyrithia lies the Maze of Shadows,
 a massive labyrinth of blocks where each block is either safe or dangerous. 
 You, an explorer, have been trapped inside this maze. You start at the top-left corner of the 
 maze, and your goal is to reach the bottom-right corner, where the exit awaits.

However, the maze is treacherous. Some blocks are cursed and cannot be stepped on,
 represented by the number 1. These blocks are impassable. The remaining blocks are safe,
  represented by the number 0, and you can walk on them.

Your task is to find the shortest path through the maze to escape from the top-left
 corner to the bottom-right corner. You can move up, down, left, or right, but you cannot
  move diagonally. If there is no possible way to escape, the maze will trap you forever.

Can you find your way out of the Maze of Shadows?
